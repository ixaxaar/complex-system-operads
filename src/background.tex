\subsection{Phase Transitions and Emergence in Complex Systems}

\subsubsection{Phase Transitions}

Phase transitions traditionally refer to qualitative changes in the state of a physical system, such as the transition from liquid to gas or the onset of magnetization in ferromagnets. The hallmark of these transitions is a sudden change in system properties at a critical point, characterized by power-law scaling behaviors and critical exponents \citep{newman2003structure, bak1987self, stanley1971phase}. In complex systems, phase transitions extend beyond physical phenomena to include abrupt shifts in collective behavior across diverse domains \citep{watts2002simple, scheffer2009critical}. Phase transitions in complex systems typically involve the emergence of new patterns or structures at a system level that are not present in individual components \citep{anderson1972more}. They are studied using a variety of mathematical and computational tools, including network theory, statistical physics, and dynamical systems theory \citep{barabasi1999emergence, strogatz2001exploring} and can be quantified through observables such as order parameters, susceptibility, and correlation functions \citep{stanley1999scaling, goldenfeld1992lectures}.

\subsubsection{Emergence}

Emergence in complex systems refers to the appearance of novel properties or behaviors at higher levels of organization that are not present at lower levels \citep{holland1998emergence, anderson1972more}. Emergent phenomena often arise from the interactions and collective dynamics of individual components, leading to the formation of new structures, patterns, or functions \citep{kauffman1993origins, gell1994quark}. Examples of emergence include the self-organization of biological systems, the emergence of intelligence in social networks, and the formation of traffic patterns in urban systems \citep{camazine2003self, haken1983synergetics}.

Phase transitions can be viewed as a subset of emergent phenomena, where the abrupt changes in system behavior correspond to the emergence of new collective states \citep{sethna2006statistical, goldenfeld1992lectures}. All phase transitions involve emergence, but not all emergent phenomena are phase transitions \citep{bar2013computability}.

\subsection{Modeling Phase Transitions and Emergence}

\subsubsection{Physical Models}

In physics, phase transitions are often modeled using statistical mechanics, where the system's behavior is described in terms of energy, entropy, and temperature \citep{stanley1971phase, kadanoff2000statistical}. The Ising model, Potts model, and percolation theory are classic examples of physical models used to study phase transitions \citep{onsager1944crystal, stauffer2018introduction}. These models capture the interactions between individual components and the emergence of collective behavior at critical points \citep{binney1992theory}. They, however, have limitations in capturing the complexity of real-world systems, such as biological, social, and technological networks but tend to be more mathematically tractable for detailed analysis \citep{newman2011structure}.

\subsubsection{Network Models}

Networks have been used since the early 20th century to model complex systems, representing entities as nodes and interactions as edges \citep{watts1998collective, barabasi1999emergence}. Formally, a network is represented as a graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices (nodes) and $E \subseteq V \times V$ is a set of edges (links). For directed networks, edges are ordered pairs $(u, v) \in E$ indicating a directed relationship from node $u$ to node $v$. For undirected networks, edges are unordered pairs $\{u, v\} \in E$.

The structure of a network can be represented by its adjacency matrix $A$, where:
\begin{equation}
A_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } (i,j) \in E \text{ (or } \{i,j\} \in E \text{ for undirected graphs)} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

For weighted networks, $A_{ij}$ represents the strength of the connection between nodes $i$ and $j$. Several key metrics characterize network properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Degree distribution} $P(k)$: The probability that a randomly selected node has $k$ connections
    \item \textbf{Clustering coefficient} $C_i$: For a node $i$ with $k_i$ neighbors, $C_i = \frac{2e_i}{k_i(k_i-1)}$ where $e_i$ is the number of links between the neighbors
    \item \textbf{Path length} $d(i,j)$: The minimum number of edges traversed to reach node $j$ from node $i$
    \item \textbf{Betweenness centrality} $B(v)$: $B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}$ where $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ and $\sigma_{st}(v)$ is the number of those paths passing through $v$
\end{itemize}

These properties can be used to classify networks into different categories, such as \textbf{scale-free}, \textbf{small-world}, and \textbf{random networks} \citep{barabasi1999emergence, watts1998collective}.

    \caption{Small-world network model illustration showing the transition from regular to random networks. \citep{watts1998collective}. A regular network transitions to a small-world network by rewiring a fraction of the edges, leading to a significant reduction in the average path length while maintaining high clustering.}
    \label{fig:small_world}
\end{figure}

Critical phenomena in networks, such as phase transitions, often manifest through sudden changes in global network properties. For instance, the emergence of a giant connected component in random networks occurs at a critical probability $p_c = \frac{1}{N}$, where $N$ is the number of nodes \citep{erdos1960evolution}.

Network models have been successful in capturing the structure and dynamics of a wide range of systems, including social networks, biological networks, and technological networks \citep{newman2003structure, albert2002statistical, strogatz2001exploring}. Networks are both a mathematically rigorous framework as well as intuitive and visually appealing, making them a popular choice for modeling complex systems \citep{newman2010networks}. Networks can capture the emergence of collective behavior through the study of network motifs, community structure, and dynamical processes on networks \citep{milo2002network, fortunato2010community, barrat2008dynamical}, and has attracted significant attention in recent years \citep{barabasi2016network}.

\subsubsection{From Networks to Simplicial Complexes}

Simplicial complexes generalize networks by incorporating higher-order interactions. Simplicial complexes can be thought of as triangles of various dimensions - vertices (0-simplices), edges (1-simplices), triangles (2-simplices), tetrahedra (3-simplices), and so on \citep{petri2014homological} connected together either via shared vertices, edges, or faces.

Formally, a simplicial complex $K$ on a vertex set $V$ is a collection of subsets of $V$ (called simplices) such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For every vertex $v \in V$, $\{v\} \in K$ (0-simplex)
    \item If $\sigma \in K$ and $\tau \subset \sigma$, then $\tau \in K$ (closure property)
\end{itemize}

A $k$-simplex $\sigma = [v_0, v_1, ..., v_k]$ represents an interaction between $k+1$ vertices. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A 0-simplex is a vertex
    \item A 1-simplex is an edge (pairwise interaction)
    \item A 2-simplex is a filled triangle (three-way interaction)
    \item A 3-simplex is a solid tetrahedron (four-way interaction)
    \item and so on
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/simplicial_complexes-1.png}
    \caption{Visual representation of simplicial complexes. The top row shows individual simplices of different dimensions (0-simplex, 1-simplex, 2-simplex, and 3-simplex). The bottom part shows a more complex simplicial complex with multiple 2-simplices (filled triangles), a 3-simplex (tetrahedron), and connecting 1-simplices (edges) that capture multi-way interactions beyond pairwise connections.}
    \label{fig:simplicial_complexes}
\end{figure}

Several researchers have successfully applied simplicial complexes to model complex systems. \citet{petri2014homological} used simplicial complexes to analyze brain functional networks, revealing topological structures that correlate with cognitive states. \citet{giusti2016two} demonstrated how simplicial complexes can capture neural coding schemes beyond what traditional network models could represent. \citet{sizemore2018importance} showed how clique topology in neural systems provides insights into brain development and function.

While simplicial complexes offer significant advantages over traditional networks, they have inherent limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They are \textit{undirected}, with no natural way to represent asymmetric interactions
    \item \textit{Temporal dynamics} are challenging to model in simplicial complexes
\end{itemize}
