In order to model complex systems using T-operads, we first look at how to model their structural hallmarks, i.e. near-decomposability including hierarchcal structures and modularity followed by self-similarity and scale invariance of the structures.

\subsection{Modeling Near-decomposability}

Modeling neardecomposability requires us to model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Subsystems}: The system can be decomposed into subsystems that interact with each other, and such interactions are specific to the subsystems.
    \item \textbf{Internal vs. external interactions}: The interactions within subsystems are stronger than those between subsystems.
    \item \textbf{Time-scale separation}: Different levels of the hierarchical structure operate at different time scales.
\end{itemize}
